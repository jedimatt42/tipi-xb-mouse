# TIPI XB Mouse

## Fully relocatable driver similar to Mechatronics API

TMORORG/O - TIPI Extended BASIC mouse driver fully RORG including mailbox 
            addresses.


## Backwards compatible with Mechatronics API

TMOUSE/O - TIPI Extended BASIC mouse driver compatible with Mechatronics 
           Mouse interface

## API

CALL INIT::CALL LOAD("TIPI.TMOUSE.TMOUSE/O")
CALL INIT::CALL LOAD("TIPI.TMOUSE.TMORORG/O")

For Mechatronics compatible driver TMOUSE/O, MBOX=10000

CALL LINK("MBASE", MBOX)
- Only in the RORG version. Look up base address for driver peek/load mailbox
  addresses.


CALL LINK("MOUSE0")
- Will block until mouse button 1 is pressed. A subsequent 
  CALL PEEK(MBOX,VPOS,HPOS) will read location data. MKEY will be 255.

CALL LINK("MOUSE1")
- Install an interupt service routine to update the mouse location and button
  status. Control flow returns to the calling XB program. Subsequent 
  CALL PEEK(MBOX,VPOS,HPOS,MKEY) calls will provide the updated status.

CALL LINK("MCLR")
- Uninstalls the interrupt service routine.

CALL LOAD(MBOX+3,VHOME,HHOME)
- stores the value of VHOME and HHOME in address MBOX+3 and MBOX+4. 
  The driver will move the pointer to this position if second mouse button 
  is pressed.

CALL LOAD(MBOX+5,LEFT,RIGHT,TOP,BOTTOM)
- stores a bounding box to contain the pointer.

## Notes

The Mechatronics driver claims to load into 0x2710 - 0x28C3 ( about 355 
bytes ). This TIPI driver is relocatable, but uses the addresses 
0x2710 - 0x2719 to preserve the same 'mailbox' communication addresses 
through CALL LOAD and CALL PEEK.

The fully relocatable version TMORORG/O does not use fixed mailbox 
addresses. Discover the value of `MBOX` by using CALL LINK("MBASE", MBOX)
